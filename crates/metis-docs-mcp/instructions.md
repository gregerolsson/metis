# Metis - Flight Levels Work Management

**Metis IS the planning and work tracking system for this project.** Do NOT use any other planning tools, task lists, or ephemeral work tracking — Metis replaces all of them. Metis documents are persistent long-term memory that survives across sessions, context windows, and agents. Use Metis initiatives for planning, Metis tasks for tracking progress, and update active tasks with findings and decisions as you work.

Metis organizes work hierarchically using Flight Levels methodology: Vision (strategic) -> Initiative (projects) -> Task (work items). Work flows down through phases; feedback flows up.

## Document Types & Phases

| Type | Purpose | Phases | Parent Required |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Vision** | Strategic direction (6mo-2yr) | draft → review → published | No |
| **Initiative** | Concrete projects (1-6mo) | discovery → design → ready → decompose → active → completed | Vision (published) |
| **Task** | Individual work (1-14 days) | todo → active → completed | Initiative (decompose/active) |
| **Backlog** | Standalone bugs/features/debt | backlog → todo → active → completed | No (use `backlog_category`) |
| **ADR** | Architecture decisions | draft → discussion → decided → superseded | No |
| **Specification** | System/feature specs (living docs) | discovery → drafting → review → published | Vision or Initiative |
| **Design** | UI/UX designs (peer of Initiative) | discovery → review → approved | Vision (any phase) |

**Note**: Configuration may disable some document types. The current project shows enabled types in tool responses.

## Phase Transition Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Phase transitions are forward-only. You cannot skip phases or go backward.

### Valid Transitions by Document Type

**Vision**: `draft → review → published`
- draft → review
- review → published
- published → (terminal)

**Initiative**: `discovery → design → ready → decompose → active → completed`
- discovery → design
- design → ready
- ready → decompose
- decompose → active
- active → completed
- completed → (terminal)

**Task**: `backlog → todo → active → completed` (with blocked as alternate state)
- backlog → todo
- todo → active OR blocked
- active → completed OR blocked
- blocked → todo OR active
- completed → (terminal)

**ADR**: `draft → discussion → decided → superseded`
- draft → discussion
- discussion → decided
- decided → superseded
- superseded → (terminal)

**Specification**: `discovery → drafting → review → published`
- discovery → drafting
- drafting → review
- review → published
- published → (terminal, but content remains editable as a living document)

**Design**: `discovery → review → approved`
- discovery → review
- review → approved (forward path: design is approved for implementation)
- review → discovery (kick-back: reviewers can send a design back for rework)
- approved → (terminal, except archive)

### What This Means

- **Cannot skip phases**: A task in "todo" cannot go directly to "completed" - it must go through "active" first
- **Cannot skip phases**: An initiative in "discovery" cannot jump to "active" - it must progress through design, ready, decompose
- **Forward-only**: Phases progress forward; use blocked state for tasks that are stuck
- **Use auto-advance**: Omit the `phase` parameter to automatically move to the next phase in sequence

## Short Codes

All documents get unique IDs: `PREFIX-TYPE-NNNN` (e.g., `PROJ-V-0001`, `ACME-T-0042`)
- **V**=Vision, **S**=Specification, **I**=Initiative, **T**=Task, **A**=ADR, **D**=Design
- Use short codes to reference documents in all operations

## CRITICAL: project_path Format

All tools require a `project_path` parameter. This **MUST** be the path to the `.metis` directory, NOT the project root.

- **Correct**: `/Users/me/my-project/.metis`
- **WRONG**: `/Users/me/my-project`

The server will attempt to auto-correct if you pass the project root, but always include `.metis` in the path.

## Tools Reference

### initialize_project
Create a new Metis workspace.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path where .metis/ will be created
prefix: string (optional) - Short code prefix, 2-8 uppercase letters (default: "PROJ")
```

### list_documents
List all documents in the project.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
include_archived: bool (optional) - Include archived docs (default: false)
```

### search_documents
Full-text search across documents.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
query: string (required) - Search text
document_type: string (optional) - Filter: vision, initiative, task, adr, specification, design
limit: number (optional) - Max results
include_archived: bool (optional) - Include archived docs (default: false)
```

### read_document
Get full document content and metadata.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Document ID (e.g., PROJ-I-0001)
```

### create_document
Create a new document.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
document_type: string (required) - vision, initiative, task, adr, specification, design
title: string (required) - Document title
parent_id: string (optional) - Parent short code (required for initiative/task/specification/design)
complexity: string (optional) - For initiatives: xs, s, m, l, xl
decision_maker: string (optional) - For ADRs
backlog_category: string (optional) - For backlog items: bug, feature, tech-debt
```
**CRITICAL**: Creating a document is only the first step. You MUST immediately follow up with `read_document` then `edit_document` to populate the content sections with actual information. A document with only template placeholders is incomplete and useless.

### edit_document
Search-and-replace edit on document content.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Document ID
search: string (required) - Text to find
replace: string (required) - Replacement text
replace_all: bool (optional) - Replace all occurrences (default: false)
```

### transition_phase
Advance document to its next phase or transition to a valid adjacent phase.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Document ID
phase: string (optional) - Target phase (must be a valid adjacent phase - see Phase Transition Rules)
force: bool (optional) - Skip exit criteria validation
```
**IMPORTANT**: You cannot skip phases. See "Phase Transition Rules" section for valid transitions from each phase.
**Best practice**: Omit `phase` to auto-advance to the next sequential phase. Only specify phase for:
- Moving to blocked state (tasks only)
- Returning from blocked to todo or active (tasks only)

**For initiatives**: ALWAYS check in with the human before transitioning phases. Summarize current state and get explicit approval to proceed.

### open_document
Open a document in an external viewer (VSCode, system editor) for review and editing.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Document ID (e.g., PROJ-I-0001)
include_children: bool (optional) - Also open child tasks (default: false)
viewer: string (optional) - Override viewer: "sys_editor", "code", or "gui"
```
**Usage**: Use this to open documents for human review at natural checkpoints — after decomposition, before phase transitions, or when the user requests to see a document. Documents are also opened proactively after `create_document` and `edit_document` unless suppressed in config.

**Viewer workflow**: After opening a document for user review, wait for the user to confirm they've reviewed it. Then use `read_document` to pick up any changes they made before continuing.

### archive_document
Archive a document and all its children.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Document ID
```

### reassign_parent
Move a task to a different parent initiative or to/from the backlog.
```
project_path: string (required) - Path to the .metis folder (e.g., "/path/to/project/.metis")
short_code: string (required) - Task short code to reassign
new_parent_id: string (optional) - Target initiative short code. Omit to move to backlog.
backlog_category: string (optional) - Required when moving to backlog: bug, feature, tech-debt
```
**Note**: Only tasks can be reassigned. Target initiative must be in `decompose` or `active` phase.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a Project
1. `initialize_project` - Create workspace
2. `create_document` type=vision - Define strategic direction
3. `transition_phase` - Move vision through draft -> review -> published
4. `create_document` type=initiative parent_id=PROJ-V-0001 - Create initiatives under vision

### Managing Work
1. `list_documents` - See all active work
2. `read_document` - Check document details and exit criteria
3. `transition_phase` - Advance work through phases
4. `edit_document` - Update content, add notes, mark blockers

### Creating Backlog Items
For standalone bugs, features, or tech debt not tied to initiatives:
```
create_document:
  document_type: "task"
  title: "Fix login timeout"
  backlog_category: "bug"  # or "feature" or "tech-debt"
```

### Decomposing Initiatives
1. Transition initiative to "decompose" phase
2. Create tasks with parent_id pointing to the initiative
3. Transition initiative to "active" when ready to execute

### Capturing UI Designs
Designs live alongside initiatives, parented to the vision. Capture all UI design work as design documents — initiatives are not required.

```
create_document:
  document_type: "design"
  title: "Onboarding flow v2"
  parent_id: "PROJ-V-0001"
```

Designs flow through `discovery → review → approved`. Use `transition_phase` with `phase: "discovery"` from review to send a design back for rework. Scratched designs are archived via `archive_document` from any phase.

### Assigning Backlog Items to Initiatives
To move a standalone backlog item into an initiative:
```
reassign_parent:
  short_code: "PROJ-T-0042"
  new_parent_id: "PROJ-I-0005"
```

To move a task back to the backlog:
```
reassign_parent:
  short_code: "PROJ-T-0042"
  backlog_category: "tech-debt"
```

## Key Principles

- **ALWAYS populate document content**: Creating a document is NOT complete until you edit it with real content. The workflow is: `create_document` → `read_document` → `edit_document` with actual information. Never leave template placeholders.
- **Read before edit**: Always `read_document` before `edit_document`. The server enforces this — edits without a prior read will be rejected. If a document was modified externally (e.g., user edited in VSCode), you must re-read before editing.
- **Open for review**: Use `open_document` at natural review points. After decomposition, open the initiative with `include_children: true` so the user can review all tasks. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.
- **Delete unused sections**: Templates contain optional sections. If a section doesn't apply to your document, delete it entirely rather than leaving it empty or with placeholder text
- **Auto-transition**: Omit phase parameter to follow natural workflow
- **Hierarchy matters**: Tasks need initiatives, initiatives need visions
- **Short codes everywhere**: Reference documents by ID, not title
- **Archive completed work**: Use `archive_document` to clean up finished trees

## Human-in-the-Loop for Strategic Work

**CRITICAL**: Initiatives represent higher-level strategic decisions that require human oversight. Agents should guide and support, but humans must remain in control of strategic direction.

### When to Check In With Humans

**ALWAYS pause and consult the human before:**
- Transitioning an initiative to a new phase
- Making architectural or design decisions
- Decomposing an initiative into tasks
- Any action that commits significant resources or direction

### Required Behaviors for Initiatives

1. **Discovery Phase**: Ask clarifying questions about scope, priorities, and constraints. Do NOT assume you understand the full context.

2. **Design Phase**: Present multiple options with trade-offs. Let the human choose the approach rather than deciding unilaterally.

3. **Before Decomposition**: Review the proposed task breakdown with the human. Get explicit approval before creating tasks.

4. **Phase Transitions**: Summarize current state, what was accomplished, and what the next phase entails. Ask for approval to proceed.

### How to Check In

When working on initiatives:
```
"Here's the current state of [INITIATIVE-CODE]:
- Completed: [summary]
- Current phase: [phase]
- Proposed next steps: [what you plan to do]

Do you want me to proceed, or would you like to adjust the direction?"
```

### What NOT to Do

- Do NOT autonomously transition initiatives through multiple phases
- Do NOT create large numbers of tasks without human review
- Do NOT make assumptions about scope or direction - ask instead
- Do NOT skip the check-in because "it seems obvious"

Agents are powerful assistants for strategic work, but the human must drive the decisions. When in doubt, ask.

## Using Active Tasks as Working Memory

**CRITICAL**: Active tasks and initiatives serve as persistent working memory. While a task is in the `active` phase, you MUST regularly update it with progress, findings, and plan changes as you work.

### Why This Matters
- Long-running tasks may experience context compaction (memory loss)
- Documents persist across sessions and context windows
- Future work can reference past decisions and discoveries
- Other agents/humans can pick up where you left off

### What to Record in Active Tasks
Update frequently during active work:
- **Progress**: What you've completed, files modified, tests run
- **Findings**: Unexpected discoveries, code patterns found, blockers encountered
- **Decisions**: Why you chose approach A over B, trade-offs considered
- **Plan changes**: If original approach didn't work, document what changed and why
- **Next steps**: What remains to be done if work is interrupted

### How Often to Update
- After completing each significant step
- When you discover something unexpected
- When your approach changes from the original plan
- Every few tool calls during long operations
- Before ending a session with incomplete work

### Example Update Pattern
```
edit_document:
  short_code: "PROJ-T-0042"
  search: "## Progress"
  replace: "## Progress\n\n### Session 1\n- Investigated auth module, found rate limiter at src/auth/limiter.rs\n- Original plan to modify middleware won't work - limiter is applied earlier\n- New approach: add bypass flag to limiter config\n- Modified: src/auth/limiter.rs, src/config/auth.yaml\n- Tests passing locally, need integration test"
```

This ensures no work is lost even if context is compacted or the session ends unexpectedly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Creating documents without content**: This is the #1 mistake. You MUST populate documents with real information immediately after creation. The correct workflow is:
1. `create_document` - Creates document with template
2. `read_document` - Read the template to see what sections exist
3. `edit_document` - Replace placeholder text with actual content

Do NOT move on to other tasks until the document has meaningful content. A document full of `{placeholder text}` is worthless.

**Phase skipping will fail**: These transitions are INVALID and will error:
- `todo → completed` (must go todo → active → completed)
- `discovery → active` (must progress through all intermediate phases)
- `draft → published` (must go draft → review → published)

**Backward transitions are not supported**: Phases only move forward. Use the blocked state for tasks that are stuck.

**To complete a task**, call `transition_phase` twice:
1. First call: todo → active (start working)
2. Second call: active → completed (finish work)

**To publish a vision**, call `transition_phase` twice:
1. First call: draft → review
2. Second call: review → published
